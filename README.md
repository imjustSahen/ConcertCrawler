## <ins>General info</ins>
The project is a web application that provides a simple interface that enables users to input a city with an optional genre filter and receive a list of concerts within a 25 mile radius.

This project was created using HTML and Javascript, as well as Foundational CSS and Tailwind CSS framework.

The project was inspired by this USER STORY:<br>
As a live Music Enthusiast I want to find concerts happening locally or anywhere Iâ€™m traveling so I can find more music to love and support the local music scene as well as artist I already enjoy listening to.
